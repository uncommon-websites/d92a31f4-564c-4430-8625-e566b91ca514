        For over 47 years, Calamos has pioneered institutional-grade alternative investment strategies for individual investors. Founded by John P. Calamos Sr., a former Air Force pilot who applied aviation risk management principles to investing, we've built our reputation on a singular philosophy: rigorous preparation and disciplined risk assessment deliver superior risk-adjusted returns.

        With $46+ billion in assets under management, we are the leading global asset manager in convertible securities. Our proprietary capital structure analysis examines the entire spectrum—equity, debt, and convertibles—to identify opportunities others miss. This isn't passive investing. This is active management backed by decades of navigating market cycles and volatility.

        Today, we're democratizing access to sophisticated strategies that were once reserved for institutional investors. Through partnerships with Registered Investment Advisors, we're bringing convertible expertise and alternative investment capabilities to the $115 trillion wealth management market.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is clear: make institutional-grade strategies accessible to all. As CEO John Koudounis states, "We don't follow trends, we create them." If you're a financial advisor seeking sophisticated products for your clients, Calamos delivers the research infrastructure, risk management discipline, and proven track record you need.
